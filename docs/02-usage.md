## Evaluation

The evaluation can be used by right-clicking on a class in the class diagram and selecting the `Evaluate class` option. A new window will be opened with all the suggestions to improve your code. When you double-click a suggestion, the editor will open at the specific line. Furthermore, when you right-click on a PMD suggestion, the documentation will open to show some examples of ways to apply this suggestion.

## Ask a question

You can access the question window by clicking on the `Tools` menu and selecting the `Ask a question` entry. This will bring up a window where you can send your question. If you get an error message saying you need to install the `groups.json` first, please refer to the [installation instructions](installation). When asking a question, fill in all fields and make sure you describe all the ways you have tried to fix the error. The first time you send a question tou will be asked to log in with a Google account. Make sure you log in using your university issued Google account, not you personal account. When you do accidentally log in with the wrong account, open the BlueJ user directory, as described in the [installation guide](installation) and remove the `StoredCredential` file. The next time you want to send a question, you can log in using the correct account.

## Enabling and disabling checks

You can pick which checks you would like to enable and disable when running the evaluation tool. This can be done by open the BlueJ Preferences menu. On Windows this is done by opening the `Tools` menu and clicking the `Preferences...` entry or with the `Ctrl + ,` shortcut. On MacOS this menu entry can be found in the `BlueJ` menu or with the `CMD + ,` shortcut. In the Preferences menu, head over to the `Extensions tab`. Here you can change all the checks. All modifications are automatically saved and applied to the next evaluation.
