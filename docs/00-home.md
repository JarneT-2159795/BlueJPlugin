Here you can find all the documentation concerning the plugin created for BlueJ. This plugin has been created for use in the joint programme for Engineering Technology from UHasselt and KU Leuven. The [installation guide](installation) will help you set up the plugin. You can learn how to use the plugin with [this short guide](usage) and can see a short explanation for the more complicated errors [here](pmd-errors). Finally, for the teaching staff, there is a [guide](teacher-info) showing how to create the groups and recompile the plugin.
